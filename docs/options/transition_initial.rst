==================
transition_initial
==================

    | type: **String**
    | default: undefined

Defines a different transition to show on the first image.
F.ex, if you are using a slide transition, you might want the first image to fade.
You can then set this option to 'fade'.

Built-in transitions

- **'fade'** crossfade betweens images
- **'flash'** fades into background color between images
- **'pulse'** quickly removes the image into background color, then fades the next image
- **'slide'** slides the images depending on image position
- **'fadeslide'** fade between images and slide slightly at the same time
