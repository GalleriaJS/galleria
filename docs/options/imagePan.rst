Galleria comes with a built-in panning effect.
The effect is sometimes useful if you have cropped images and want to let the users pan across the stage to see the entire image.

Set ``imagePan`` to ``true`` to apply a mouse-controlled movement of the image to reveal the cropped parts.
This effect is useful if you want to avoid dark areas around the image but still be able to view the entire image.

Popular on many fashion websites.

If the panning becomes slow, you can control the smoothness ( and CPU ) using the image_pan_smoothness option.
