    | type: **Array**
    | default: **['title', 'description', 'author']**

This value sets the expected info keys which will be filled in by Galleria.setInfo(). Values will match data keys from initial data source.

If custom keys are set, the defaults must still be passed if they are desired. Non-default keys should be added to the DOM during theme init.
