Galleria is a image gallery framework that is very easy to use, yet loaded with advanced customization options. Galleria and some of the themes provided here are free to use under the MIT license. Premium themes, transitions and more extras will soon be available for purchase at http://galleria.aino.se.

A good way to get started is to read the Getting Started section at http://github.com/aino/galleria/blob/master/docs/getting-started.rst

Good luck!
